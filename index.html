            <h2>Why sustainable?</h2>
            <h3>Efficient & effective use of space</h3>
            <p>
              Interior sustainability is about the needs of the present without
              compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own.
              Sustainable interior design is environmentally conscious with an
              emphasis on recycled materials. It is home design that reduces
              negative impacts on the environment, while increasing the health
              and comfort of its occupants, while focusing on eco friendly
              design.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sustainability is important because the quality of life, and the
              diversity of Earths' ecosystems cannot be maintained without it.
              Eventually fossil fuels will run out, so this is something that
              must be addressed. Eco friendly interior design in a home made
              with green materials can increase energy efficiency and is
              definitely something interior designers should have in mind.

            <p>
              Hi! My name is Natalie and for several years I on the mission to
              live more and more in a sustainable way. What I am really
              passionate about, is affordable and cozy interior design which
              includes mainly upcycling, recycling and give old furniture a new
              life and my surrounding a stunning character.
