            <h2>Why sustainable?</h2>
            <h3>Efficient & effective use of space</h3>
            <p>
              Interior sustainability is about the needs of the present without
              compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own.
              It is environmentally conscious design with an emphasis on
              recycled materials, which reduces negative impacts on the
              environment, while increasing the health and comfort of its
              occupants and focusing on eco friendly design.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sustainability is important because the quality of life, and the
              diversity of Earths' ecosystems cannot be maintained without it.
              Eventually fossil fuels will run out, so this is something that
              must be addressed. Eco friendly interior design in a home made
              with green materials can increase energy efficiency and is
              definitely something interior designers consider in their work.

                <h4>Fresh Black Roastery & Bar</h4>
                <p>
                  This project is a combined food-business space in Reytarska
                  Circle, located in a round modernist building after an
                  extensive renovation. The once swimming pool space has been
                  incorporated into the principal design as the "Coffee Roasting
                  Theatre", which accommodates tables for up to 20 people, along
                  with a degustation table, roaster, packaging corner and a
                  warehouse for final products. In addition, the art gallery
                  depicts Kyiv's local cafes. A multifunctional space joined
                  together a variety of businesses. Fresh Black Roastery and
                  Bar's democratic atmosphere is a positive example of how a
                  postmodern building can be updated and adapted for new public
                  and commercial functions.

                <p>
                  Maison Jar is a low-waste grocery store located in Brooklyn,
                  New York City; a one-stop shop for food, home essentials and
                  personal care items all without unnecessary packaging. Whether
                  sampling something new, buying for a single meal, or stocking
                  up for the season, customers can pick the quantity of a
                  product they need. "Sustainability was at the core of the
                  design process, said designers EAA/D Studio Inc. "Durable,
                  recycled and natural materials have been selected for an
                  eco-conscious approach, referencing core values of Maison
                  Jar." The neighbourhood refillery now thrives on being a
                  welcoming place for conviviality and an inspiring retail
                  destination for the local community and New Yorkers.

                <h4>Tiny Eco House</h4>
                <p>
                  This project was a collaboration between Tiny House Builders
                  and Adesignstorie where a tiny eco holiday home, located in
                  the idyllic Scottish Highlands, was built. From the bin
                  placement to local ecotourism suggestions in the guidebook,
                  the user experience is mapped out to weave sustainable
                  behaviour into their visit. The multifunctional layout and
                  modular joinery design minimises materials and maximises
                  functionality and flexibility, while the majority of the
                  interior finishes and furnishings are reclaimed and layered
                  with innovative eco-conscious materials. The ultimate goal of
                  the Tiny Eco House was to create a natural timeless palette
                  that reflects the local landscape.

              Hi! My name is Natalie and for several years now I on the mission
              to live more and more sustainable. What I am really passionate
              about, are affordable and cozy interiors which are mainly based on
              upcycling, recycling, giving old furniture a new life and as a
              result my surrounding a stunning character.
